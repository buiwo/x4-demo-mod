# x4-demo-mod
Well, this is the most basic mod imaginable for X4:Foundations. 

It's just the content.xml with the mod description, but the 'mod' doesn't do anything to the game. ;-)

## Installation

To install the mod
1. Download the zipped archive
2. You might have to create the folder "extensions" in your X4 root game folder
3. Extract the ZIP and place the containing folder into the 'extensions' folder
4. Load the game and 'enjoy' the mod ;-)
